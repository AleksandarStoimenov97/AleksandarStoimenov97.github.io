        <p class="subheader">Benjamin Loyauté</p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Benjamin Loyauté is known as a story-teller, for his committed statement and work on the ordinary
          and intangible heritage of communities, the forms of beliefs and contemporary changes.
          Through poetic systems, his practice and artwork explore new situations.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          He is focused in the forms of appropriation of our faculties of perception.
          He is leading thinking on our contemporary societies through the magical & political status
          of the ordinary. He works with a variety of mediums from ﬁlms, sculptures to public interventions
          and installations.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The work done for Benjamin consists mainly of translating his ideas spatially. Currently,
          this has been done through the creation of 3D models, animations and VR experiences.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The projects carried out often require work in close proximity with Benjamin
          because the deadlines are unpredictable and the orders for the exhibitions often change.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          As of now, I had the opportunity to help him present his work to the public during the "Nuit Blanche",
          a night-time arts festival organized by the city of Paris.
